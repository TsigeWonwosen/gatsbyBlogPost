### 9 Ways to Optimize API Calls in Next.js for Faster Performance

You launch your sleek Next.js app, expecting lightning-fast performance.

But instead, your users are stuck staring at a loading spinner, tapping their feet like they’re waiting for dial-up internet in the ’90s. Sound familiar? Yeah, it’s frustrating.

You Google “optimize API calls in Next.js,” and BAM! You’re hit with a tsunami of half-baked solutions and outdated advice. “Just cache everything!” they say. “Use server-side rendering for all your data!” they insist.

It’s time to cut through the nonsense.

I’ll break down the real ways to make your Next.js API calls snappy — no myths, just battle-tested strategies.

#### 1. Always Use Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for API Calls

SSR is Not a Magic Wand

Some developers act like SSR is the holy grail of performance. “Pre-render everything on the server!” they say. But here’s the catch: If your API response…

#### What to Do Instead?✅

Use SSR only when:

The data must be fresh on every request (e.g., stock prices, breaking news).
The API doesn’t allow caching (which is rare but happens).
For most cases? Stick with Static Site Generation (SSG) or Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) to pre-fetch data and serve blazing-fast pages.

```js
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
  const data = await res.json()
  return {
    props: { data },
    revalidate: 60, // Re-fetch every 60 seconds
  }
}
```

#### 2. Fetch Data in Every Component

Congratulations, You’ve Invented the “Waterfall of Doom”

Fetching data inside multiple components individually? That’s a one-way ticket to sluggish performance. Every render triggers separate API calls. Your app slows down, and your users question their life choices.

##### What to Do Instead?✅

Use React Query or SWR to centralize data fetching and caching.

```js
import useSWR from "swr"

const fetcher = url => fetch(url).then(res => res.json())

export default function Component() {
  const { data, error } = useSWR("/api/user", fetcher)
  if (error) return <div>Failed to load</div>
  if (!data) return <div>Loading...</div>

  return <div>Hello, {data.name}</div>
}
```

This way, data is fetched once and shared across components. Simple, right?

#### 3. Client-Side Fetching is Always Bad

No, It’s Not. Use It When It Makes Sense.

You don’t always need SSR or SSG. Sometimes, fetching data on the client side is the right call. For example✅

User-specific data (e.g., authentication, user settings)
Real-time updates (e.g., live sports scores)
Lazy loading after the page renders
Use useEffect or React Query to fetch client-side data efficiently.

```js
import { useEffect, useState } from "react"

export default function ClientData() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("/api/some-endpoint")
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setData(data))
  }, [])

  return <div>{data ? JSON.stringify(data) : "Loading..."}</div>
}
```

#### 4. Cache Aggressively (When Possible)

Stop making unnecessary API calls. Use caching wisely:

- Browser caching: Store data in localStorage or sessionStorage if it doesn’t change often.

- CDN caching: Use a CDN for static API responses.
- Next.js ISR: Update pages at set intervals without rebuilding the entire app.

```js
localStorage.setItem("data", JSON.stringify(data))
const cachedData = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("data"))
```

### 5. Debounce & Throttle Requests

If your app makes API calls on every keystroke, congratulations — you’re DDOS-ing yourself. Use debouncing or throttling to limit requests.

```js
import { useState } from "react"
import { debounce } from "lodash"

const fetchData = debounce(async query => {
  const res = await fetch(`/api/search?q=${query}`)
  return res.json()
}, 300)

export default function Search() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState("")

  return (
    <input
      onChange={e => {
        setQuery(e.target.value)
        fetchData(e.target.value)
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

#### 6. Parallelize Your Requests

Fetching data sequentially? That’s cute, but slow. Use Promise.all() to make multiple requests at once.

```js
const [users, posts] = await Promise.all([
  fetch("/api/users").then(res => res.json()),
  fetch("/api/posts").then(res => res.json()),
])
```

#### 7. Use Edge Functions for Faster API Responses

Next.js now supports Edge Functions — tiny, lightweight serverless functions that run closer to the user. Use them to fetch API data with ultra-low latency.

#### 8. Optimize Database Queries (Because Your API is Only as Fast as Your DB)

If your backend is slow, no frontend magic will save you. Use:

- **Indexes** for faster queries
- **Pagination** to limit results
- **Caching** layers like Redis

### 9. Measure & Optimize Regularly

Use tools like:

Lighthouse (for performance audits)
Chrome DevTools (to analyze network requests)
Next.js profiler (to spot slow components)
Finally, Stop Following Outdated Advice
Not all API optimization tips are good.

Use the right approach for your use case, and don’t blindly follow “best practices” that were best practices in 2015.
