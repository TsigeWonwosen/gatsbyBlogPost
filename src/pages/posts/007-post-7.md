### If You’re Ignoring AI, You’re Ignoring Free Money

Why sleeping on AI is the most expensive nap you’ll ever take.

Let’s get something straight,

If you’re still pretending AI is “just a fad,” you’re basically walking past hundred-dollar bills on the sidewalk because you’re too busy checking if your floppy disk still works.

Yeah, I said it.

I used to think the same. Thought ChatGPT was just a glorified Clippy with a college degree. Fast forward three months, I automated my client proposals, rewrote my website copy, and launched a digital product — all with AI.

#### That wasn’t productivity.

1. That was wizardry.

So if you’re sitting there thinking AI is for tech bros and Silicon Valley weirdos, buckle up. You’re about to feel violently seen.

Myth👉 “AI will replace me.”
No. AI won’t replace you.

But someone using AI will.

You don’t have to marry the machine. Just take it out for coffee and see what it can do.
