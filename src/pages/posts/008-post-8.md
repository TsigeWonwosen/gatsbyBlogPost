### React 19 Memoization: No More useMemo & useCallback?

As React developers, we have used useMemo and useCallback for years to keep our applications efficient and avoid uncalled re-renders. It is a constant battle between knowing when to optimize and when to let React do its thing. But with React 19, the whole scenario changes.

The new React Compiler is a groundbreaking innovation. It takes optimization to the next level because the compiler will handle performance boosters all by itself and will free us from micromanaging whether we should do memoization or not.

In this blog, we’ll explore how memoization worked before React 19, what the React Compiler does, and whether you still need useMemo and useCallback.

#### The Problem with Manual Memoization

##### What is Memoization in React?

Memoization is an optimization technique that stores the result of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again. In React, it prevents unnecessary re-renders of components and functions.

##### Why Did We Use useMemo and useCallback?

Before React 19, React would recreate functions and recompute values on every render, even when not necessary. To optimize performance, we had to manually use:

. useMemo to memoize expensive calculations.

. useCallback to prevent unnecessary function re-creations.

##### Example (Before React 19):

```js
import { useState, useMemo, useCallback } from "react";

function ExpensiveComponent({ num }) {
const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => {
console.log("Computing...!");
return num \* 2;
}, [num]);

const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
console.log("Button clicked!");
}, []);

return (

<div>
<p>Computed Value: {expensiveValue}</p>
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
</div>
);
}
```

✅ Optimization Done Manually:

Without useMemo, expensiveValue would be recalculated on every render.
Similarly, useCallback prevents handleClick from being recreated.
🚨 The Problem:

Manually wrapping functions and values increases complexity.
Overusing useMemo and useCallback can actually make code harder to read and maintain.
The React 19 Solution: Automatic Memoization
With React 19, the new React Compiler eliminates the need for excessive memoization. It automatically optimizes functions and values, reducing re-renders without requiring useMemo and useCallback.

#### How Does the React Compiler Work?

The React Compiler analyzes your components and automatically optimizes them by:

- Detecting unnecessary re-renders and skipping them.
- Memoizing expensive calculations behind the scenes.
- Ensuring stable function references to prevent prop changes from triggering re-renders.

##### Example (React 19 — No More useMemo & useCallback!)

```js
function ExpensiveComponent({ num }) {
  function computeValue() {
    console.log("Computing...!")
    return num * 2
  }

  function handleClick() {
    console.log("Button clicked!")
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Computed Value: {computeValue()}</p>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

✅ No Manual Memoization Needed:

The compiler automatically optimizes function calls and ensures handleClick doesn’t get recreated unnecessarily.
🚀 Result:

Cleaner, more readable, and efficient code without extra work!

##### Do You Still Need useMemo and useCallback?

While React 19 significantly reduces the need for manual memoization, there are some edge cases where useMemo and useCallback might still be useful:

###### When Should You Still Use useMemo?

- When working with third-party libraries that rely on memoized values.

If you’re performing extremely expensive calculations that React’s optimizations don’t catch.

When Should You Still Use useCallback?
When passing functions to components that depend on strict reference equality (e.g., memoized child components with React.memo).
However, in most cases, you don’t need them anymore! 🎉

#### Best Practices & Common Mistakes

##### ✅ Best Practices

- Write simple code first and let React optimize it automatically.
- Use useMemo and useCallback sparingly, only when truly necessary.
- Test performance before optimizing — don’t assume something is slow.

##### ❌ Common Mistakes

- Overusing useMemo and useCallback unnecessarily, making code - more complex.
- Forgetting to update to React 19 before relying on automatic optimizations.

#### Conclusion 🎯

React 19’s automatic memoization through the React Compiler is a game-changer for performance optimization. It simplifies development by eliminating unnecessary re-renders without requiring manual memoization.

So, if you’re still manually optimizing everything, it’s time to upgrade and enjoy cleaner, faster React code!
